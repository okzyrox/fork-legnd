# SDL2 Installation Guide

## Dependencies

#### SDL installed
- Just install via `requirements.txt` through PIP, it will then default to using your installation of SDL2.


#### SDL not installed

- If you don't have SDL2 installed, then you can use the `requirements_nosdl.txt` installation requirements in PIP instead.
